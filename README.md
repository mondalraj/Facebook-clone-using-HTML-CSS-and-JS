# Facebook-clone-using-HTML-CSS-and-JS
I have created this Facebook clone to get rid of basic yet necessary concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to master the fundamentals so that I can jump to the front end frameworks like react.js and materialise.css or semantic UI in order to reduce complexity and coding time and also increasing the efficiency.
